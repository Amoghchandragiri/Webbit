## Project Description
This website basically offers a range of services by seniors of PCCOE to their juniors so that they can learn new and emerging technologies and
upskill themselves. The sessions are organized by seniors of PCCOE to their juniors , motivating them to learn skills apart from their curriculum.
This helps juniors a lot as they get a platform to learn new skills and network with their seniors.This website consists of only 1 page made using HTML and CSS and is static in nature. It contains services offered by the coding club and detailed description of each service. It also contains a feedback mechanism to address the queries of students.

I am open to any changes made in my project and would like to invite all of you to collaborate with me and introduce some cool changes which would make the website make more responsive and dynamic in nature.
