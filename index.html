          Our Coding Club dates back to 2012 when it first started. It was started as an initiative led by 3rd year Seniors at that time to help their juniors in acquiring skills and getting to know about the various talents and skills which they should possess before graduation.

          The Club's main intention was to enlighten juniors about the competitiveness of the job market and the cutting-edge technologies on which famous tech companies are working on. In this club, Seniors help juniors learn technologies and frameworks outside of their syllabus and be enthusiastic to learn more about them.Below are the various fields our Club members try to educate about our juniors upon.
